Understand Kubernetes Architecture & Deploy a Sample Pod

In kubernetes architecture there is a cluster, where we get master-node and worker-node. 

CLUSTER:- A group of server work together as a single system.

Maste node/control plane componemts:

API SERVER:- Api server provides the interface to interact with the cluster. Api server validate requestes and process tihe request to the backend component
ETCD:- It is the database of kubernetes. It store the information about cluster like part of cluster nodes, running pods and more.
SCHEDULAR:- The mastermind of your containers, when you want to run a container and ask for it, schedular is decide on which node the container is running. And it also consider the resource availability.
CONTROLLER MANAGER:- Who always monitor the cluster to match between cluster state and our desire state.

Worker node components:

KUBELET:- Ensuring that the every containers on node are healthy and working properly. It is a manager of node.
SERVER PROXY:- It allows to connect between pod and external client and external client to pod.

A SAMPLE POD:- 

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  namespace: nginx-ns  
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
